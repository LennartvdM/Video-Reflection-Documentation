# 2.1 Previewing

The first step after a procedure has been recorded involves capturing insights from the medical team who performed the procedure. During this video-assisted debrief you can gather notes, observations, and reflections of the team members who performed the procedure. These insights add the necessary context and background to the video review session.&#x20;

* [ ] First, check if everyone gave consent for the recording.
* [ ] Second, review the video with them.
* [ ] Lastly, ask for permission for use of the video in the plenary review session.&#x20;

**Questions to ask during preview:**

* What do you notice when you watch the video?&#x20;
  *   > “What do you think went well?”

      > “What do you think could be done differently?”

      > “What could be further improved?”
      >
      > "What stands out in this video?"
* Did you notice anything, while watching the video, that you don't remember, but that becomes apparent in the video?
* Is there anything we can't see on the video, context-like, that we need to know when reviewing the video during video review? Such as stress on the ward, change of shifts or time of day?
* Is there anything specific you would like your colleagues' advice on? Any questions we can ask (for you) during the plenary video review session?&#x20;
* Do you give consent for use of the video during the plenary video review session?&#x20;
