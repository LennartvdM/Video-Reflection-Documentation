# 2.1 Previewing

After a procedure has been recorded, follow these steps to gather valuable insights from the medical team:

* [ ] **Obtain Consent:** Ensure all team members present in the recording have provided consent for its use.
* [ ] **Video-Assisted Debrief:** Conduct a review session with the team, using the video recording to guide the discussion. Focus on:
  * [ ] Observations and reflections on the procedure
  * [ ] Contextual factors influencing decision-making
* [ ] **Request Plenary Use Permission:** Obtain explicit permission from the team to utilize the video and accompanying insights during the larger plenary review session.

**Questions to ask during preview:**

* What do you notice when you watch the video?&#x20;
  *   > “What do you think went well?”

      > “What do you think could be done differently?”

      > “What could be further improved?”
      >
      > "What stands out in this video?"
* Did you notice anything, while watching the video, that you don't remember, but that becomes apparent in the video?
* Is there anything we can't see on the video, context-like, that we need to know when reviewing the video during video review? Such as stress on the ward, change of shifts or time of day?
* Is there anything specific you would like your colleagues' advice on? Any questions we can ask (for you) during the plenary video review session?&#x20;
* Do you give consent for use of the video during the plenary video review session?&#x20;



**Questions for Video-Assisted Debriefing**

**Opening Observation:**

* "As you watch the video, what initial details and actions stand out to you?"

**Positive Focus:**

* "What aspects of the procedure went particularly well?"

**Opportunities for Improvement:**

* "Are there areas where you see potential for a different approach or refinement?"
* "What elements, if any, could be further improved?"

**Retrospective Insights:**

* "Did the video reveal anything you didn't consciously notice during the procedure?"

**Contextual Awareness:**

* "Are there factors not visible in the video (like ward stress, time of day, etc.) that influenced the procedure and should be considered?"

**Collaborative Support:**

* "Do you have specific questions or areas where you'd like feedback from colleagues during the plenary session?"

**Consent:**

* "Do you consent to the use of this video and our discussion in the plenary video review session?"
