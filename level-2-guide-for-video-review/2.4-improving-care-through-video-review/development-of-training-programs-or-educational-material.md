# Development of training programs or educational material

| Intubation commands video: the video review sessions on intubation identified a difference in interpretation of the commands that were given during intubation. For instance, ‘lifting’ the (video) laryngoscope represents a certain technique and movement, which is not interpreted in the exact same way by all staff members. Based on these findings a video of the commands with corresponding movements and techniques was made and presented to the team as a training tool. Following sessions did not focus on this again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Effective communication: various video review sessions showed that closed-loop communication remained challenging. It was discussed that caregivers needed to communicate instructions and responses in a clear and specific way. Therefore, recordings of best practice in communication during neonatal stabilization were combined in a video that was shown in the Newborn Life Support (NLS) training of all staff members at the NICU. In following sessions, other themes emerged, such as the importance of role differentiation before starting an  intervention and checking if preparation was complete and all equipment was present. All findings combined, the need for a structured ‘time-out’ was identified. For one, it could help to activate a sense of participation among caregivers. By performing a time-out before the procedure, caregivers might be more prone to speak up later during the intervention. Second, it could help with role differentiation and preparation. The _Neoflix_ study group has started the design of a checklist for a time-out procedure. First a draft version was made and discussed with medical and nursing staff. Then the time-out checklist was tested, whilst recording it. This video was evaluated during a video review session. Afterwards, the time-out checklist was adjusted again before it was implemented as standard care. |
