**Video Review as a Catalyst for Research and Practice Improvement**

Building upon the work of van Vonderen et al. (2014), which demonstrated the power of video review to uncover knowledge gaps in stabilization procedures, Heesters et al. (2023) addressed this gap using an observational study using ultrasonography to visualize vocal cords. Here's how their work highlights the research-generating potential of video review:

1. **Identifying the Problem:** Video analysis pinpointed specific areas of neonatal stabilization where knowledge was lacking. These observations became the foundation for a targeted research question: do the vocal cords obstruct non-invasive ventilation when an infant <30 weeks is apneic at birth?
2. **Data-Driven Research Design** Heesters et al. designed their observational study to investigate the identified knowledge gaps. This data collection was directly informed by the insights gleaned from video review.
3. **Actionable Findings:** The study's findings provided concrete evidence about the position of the vocal cords during stabilization at birth. This evidence, rooted in real-world practice observations, became a powerful driver for recommendations to enhance future practice.
4. **Closing the Loop:** The proposed improvements, grounded in the video-supported research, can subsequently be evaluated using the same video review methodology. This creates a continuous cycle of refinement informed by both research and ongoing practice observation.

**Key Takeaway:** This example showcases how video review is not only a tool for immediate practice improvement, but a valuable springboard for research that generates impactful, evidence-based changes in medical care.
