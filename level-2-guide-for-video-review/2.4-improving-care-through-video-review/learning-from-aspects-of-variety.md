# Learning from aspects of variety

Comfort of infant: during video review meetings of procedures performed on the NICU it was discussed that nurses could take on a leading role in determining how much sedation was needed, as they know the baby best. These tips were communicated to the entire team. Afterwards nurses became more assertive in determining the level of comfort for the infant during procedures, as was observed in following video review sessions.

Parentsâ€™ perspective: parents were invited to review recordings of stabilization as well. By reviewing these videos with parents, we had the chance to ask parents how they experienced this period, what they were thinking and what they needed from the NICU-team at the time. Their input was used in the _Neoflix_ session of that video by sharing quotes from parents.
