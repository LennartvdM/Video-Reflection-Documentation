**Tap into Participant Feedback for Enhanced **_**Neoflix**_** Sessions**

Gathering feedback after each _Neoflix_ session is a powerful way to see its effectiveness and uncover ways to improve the experience. Here's a streamlined approach:

* **Quick and Easy:** Use a brief, anonymous questionnaire accessible via QR code. Distribute it immediately after each session for the freshest insights.
* **Targeted Questions:** Center your questions around these key areas:
  * **Participant Takeaways:** "What did you learn from this session?" Compare this to your own conclusions to assess knowledge transfer.
  * **Safe Space:** "Do you feel safe enough to express yourself and to voice your opinion?" (Scale of 1-5). This is crucial for productive learning.
  * **Open Feedback:** "What went well? What could be improved? Do you have suggestions for future Neoflix sessions?"

**Essential Starter Questions:**

* **Position:** "What is your position within the team?" (Options: Nurse, Doctor, Other)
* **Feedback Rules:** "Is the use of feedback rules sufficient?" (Scale of 1-5, with rules clearly stated)
* **Participation:** "Do you get enough opportunity to speak?" (Scale of 1-5)

**Why This Matters:** Honest participant feedback is the key to creating _Neoflix_ sessions that continuously evolve and provide maximum value to your team!
