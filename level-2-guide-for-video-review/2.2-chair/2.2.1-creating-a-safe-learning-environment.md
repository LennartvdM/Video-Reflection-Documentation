# 2.2.1 Creating a safe learning environment

* **The Foundation of Success:** Emphasize that building a safe, supportive learning environment is the fundamental prerequisite for effective video review. Acknowledge that this takes ongoing effort.
* **Inclusivity:** Encourage the participation of all providers involved in hands-on care. Diverse perspectives enrich the learning experience.
* **Reinforce Rules & Goals:** Before each session, reiterate:
  * **Purpose of Video Review:** Collaborative learning, not judgment.
  * **Perfection vs. Growth:** The focus is on understanding team dynamics in context, not achieving flawlessness.
  * **Feedback Rules:** Remind everyone to be specific, focus on observable behaviors, and avoid personalization or judgment.

It can be helpful to use **feedback rules**:
