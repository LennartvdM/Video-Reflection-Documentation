# 2.2.1 Rules of the game

The most precondition of organizing video review, is building a safe learning environment. This can take time. So it is important to repeat the rules and the goal of video review before each session.

We would recommend to organize video review with all providers involved in hands-on care. The chair can introduce the goal of video review: to learn together, not to judge. It is not about being perfect, but about learning from how the team functions in the specific context of the situation.&#x20;

It can be helpful to use feedback rules:

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Be specific and to the point</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Focus on behaviour, do not make it personal</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Describe the situation without judgement</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
