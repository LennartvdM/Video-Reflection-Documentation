# 9. Education and training

Embrace the power of self-reflection and peer support! Video review provides a safe and structured space for trainees to examine their own performance, gain valuable insights from their peers, and foster a growth-oriented mindset. Learn how to identify strengths, tackle areas for improvement, and gain a broader perspective on patient care.

### Structuring peer review sessions

#### Structured Format: Use a guided framework for feedback to promote objectivity and reduce personal bias.

* Respectful Tone: Emphasize that the goal is mutual growth. Focus on observations instead of judgments.
* Encourage Self-Reflection: Allow the provider being reviewed to share their perspective first and identify their own areas for improvement.

#### "Highlight Reel" Technique: Creating a curated collection...

* Positive Learning Tool: Showcasing best practices motivates and models excellence for the entire team.
* Teaching Resource: Excellent segments become valuable teaching tools for new staff or when refining procedures.

#### Integrating Feedback: Turning actionable feedback...

* Individualized Action Plans: Help translated feedback into SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) for each provider.
* System-Wide Improvements: Recurring themes across reviews indicate potential changes at the protocol or workflow level.
