## Video Review: A Tool for Implementing Change in Clinical Practice

Introducing new practices in healthcare can be challenging. Video review offers a powerful way to support knowledge transfer, skill development, and smooth implementation:

### How It Helps:

* Demonstrating New Techniques: Recordings of expert providers performing new procedures offer visual step-by-step guidance that complements written protocols.
* Highlighting Best Practices: Curated video examples showcase effective approaches and reinforce recommended guideline changes.
* Addressing Variation: Analyzing recordings can identify practice inconsistencies, facilitating targeted training or protocol modifications to streamline adoption.
* Self-Assessment: Allowing providers to record and review their own performance of new techniques fosters self-reflection and accelerates learning.
* "Before and After" Comparison: Reviewing videos pre- and post-implementation can visualize the impact of changes and motivate continued improvement.

#### Strategies for Success:

* High-Quality Examples: Focus on recordings demonstrating clear technique, effective communication, and optimal workflow with new procedures.
* Interactive Sessions: Combine video-watching with discussion for clarifications and to address potential challenges.
* Supplement, Not Replace: Video augments hands-on training and mentorship but doesn't fully substitute them.
* Provider Feedback: Gather input on how videos could be more helpful as they adapt to new practices or guidelines.

#### Additional Use Cases:

* Orientating New Staff: Videos provide a standardized introduction to protocols and expected practices.
* Interdisciplinary Training: Recordings facilitate coordinated learning across different clinical roles.
* Remote Learning: Video examples facilitate knowledge sharing in settings with limited in-person access to experts or mentors.

Video review visualizes new techniques and guidelines in action. It offers a flexible and engaging learning tool that supports smooth transitions with the goal of improving patient care.
