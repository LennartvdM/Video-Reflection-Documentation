# 2.1 Obtain Consent

## Consent for emergent procedures

So, everyone on your team has been informed about the start of your video review program. Obtaining informed consent is a cornerstone of ethical healthcare practice. However, emergent settings often limit the ability to obtain traditional informed consent. Time-critical interventions may be necessary to preserve life or health, leaving little opportunity for in-depth discussions. &#x20;

**Triple Consent for Video Recording: Best Practices**

Triple consent for video recording adds a layer of protection in both emergent and non-emergent settings, respecting provider autonomy and promoting a collaborative learning environment:

1. **Pre-Procedure Consent:**
   * Briefly explain the purpose of recording (e.g., quality improvement, education).
   * Acknowledge that participation is voluntary and will not affect care.
   * Be sensitive to potential concerns and offer alternatives if possible or simply don't record the procedure.&#x20;
2. **Post-Procedure Consent:**
   * Allow providers to review the recording privately.
   * Obtain explicit consent for further use, especially if the video is identifiable.
   * Discuss any learning points or feedback with the providers involved.
3. **Pre-Review Consent:**
   * Obtain consent again before using the video in a wider educational setting (e.g., team review).
   * Respect the right to decline, even if previous consent was given.
   * Involve the recorded providers in preparing review sessions to foster ownership.

**Challenges and Solutions in Emergent Settings:**

* **Time Constraints:** Pre-procedure consent may be a brief verbal explanation. Ensure post-procedure consent is obtained as soon as the situation allows.
* **Respect and Sensitivity:** Acknowledge the potentially stressful situation for providers while still offering the choice of recording.
* **Documentation:** If written consent is not feasible, detailed documentation of verbal consent and the rationale is crucial.
