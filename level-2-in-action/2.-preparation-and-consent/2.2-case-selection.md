# 2.2 Case selection

While video review offers immense learning potential, careful case selection is crucial to maximize benefits and ensure a respectful, productive environment. Considerations include:

* **Learning Objectives:** Identify specific goals for review sessions. These may include technical skill assessment, teamwork and communication analysis, or exploring complex decision-making processes.
* **Variation in Practice:** Select cases that highlight both successes and areas for improvement. This provides a balanced perspective and fosters a growth mindset.
* **Sensitivity:** Prioritize provider privacy and confidentiality. Be mindful of sensitive procedures or situations that might cause discomfort for providers.
* **Provider Input:** Involve providers in case selection, particularly those directly involved in the recorded case. This fosters ownership of the learning process and can uncover valuable perspectives.

**Conclusion**

Thoughtful case selection, coupled with a respectful multiple-consent process, transforms video review into a powerful tool. It empowers providers, drives quality improvement, and avoids potential pitfalls.
