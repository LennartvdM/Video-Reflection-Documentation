# 2.3 Privacy Considerations

## **Privacy Considerations and Handling Refusal**

Video recording in healthcare settings raises legitimate privacy concerns for both patients and providers. It's essential to balance the benefits of quality improvement with the need to protect individual rights and maintain trust.

* **Patient Privacy:** If possible, prioritize recording angles where patient identification is minimal or obtain explicit patient consent for identifiable recordings. Consider de-identification techniques (e.g., blurring faces, voice modulation) when appropriate.
* **Provider Privacy:** Respecting provider autonomy is crucial. Triple consent procedures emphasize the right to refuse recording at any stage, without negative consequences.
* **Confidentiality and Storage:** Establish [secure storage protocols](../../level-1-fundamentals/1.-preproduction/1.7-safe-simple-and-small/simple/) for video data, ensuring access is restricted to authorized personnel only.
* **Institutional Policies:** Hospitals and units may have clear [guidelines](../../level-1-fundamentals/1.-preproduction/1.7-safe-simple-and-small/safe/check-for-institutional-rules.md) on video recording, storage, consent procedures, and use, aligning with data protection regulations.

**Handling Refusal**

If a provider declines recording at any stage:

* **Acceptance without Consequence:** Emphasize that their choice is respected and will not impact their care or standing within the team.&#x20;
* **Exploring Alternatives:** If possible, offer alternatives such as individual reviewing of the video only, as that can also have multiple benefits. It doesn't always have to be used for plenary video review.
* **Documenting Decisions:** Clear documentation of both consent and refusal is important for transparency and potential future reference.

**Conclusion**

Addressing privacy concerns and respecting the right to refuse are integral to ethical video review implementation. By establishing clear procedures, fostering a culture of open communication, and prioritizing provider comfort, institutions can harness the power of video review while maintaining the trust of patients and staff.
