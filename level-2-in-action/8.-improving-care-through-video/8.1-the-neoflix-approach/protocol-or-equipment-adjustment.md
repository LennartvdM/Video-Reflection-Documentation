# Protocol or equipment adjustment

Initial video review revealed a practice that i[ncreased contamination risk during sterile line insertions](https://app.gitbook.com/s/MdMcavmFWyJ3gxr9PXYq/summaries-articles/4.-record-reflect-and-refine): providers were placing sterile gloves near the sink before washing their hands. This led to the following iterative improvement cycle:

1. **Protocol Adjustment:** The protocol was revised to prohibit using the sink area for sterile gloves. This change was communicated to the team.
2. **Observation & Iteration:** Subsequent video reviews showed the practice persisted, indicating a need for further intervention.
3. **Reinforcement:** The protocol adjustment was reiterated through a team newsletter.
4. **Success:** Follow-up video reviews demonstrated adherence to the revised protocol, confirming a sustained improvement.

**Key Takeaway:** Video review offers a powerful tool to identify areas for improvement, implement changes, and evaluate the effectiveness of those changes in a continuous cycle.
