# 7.2 Tasks of the chair

## Tasks of the chair

**Goal Setting & Philosophy**

* **Define the Mission:** Clearly state that Neoflix is a space for shared learning and improvement, not a pursuit of perfection. Emphasize a blame-free, supportive environment.

**Preparation**

* **Obtain Consent:** Ensure all recorded providers have explicitly agreed to the use of the video.
* **Video Editing:**
  * Cut the video into focused fragments, ideally totaling 15 minutes for ample discussion time.
  * Consider a thematic focus (e.g., communication) if desired, or allow open discussion.
* **Provider Invitation:** Invite recorded caregivers to attend the review session to provide context and foster a sense of safety.

**Session Introduction**

* **Reaffirm Feedback Rules:** Remind everyone of the guidelines for constructive feedback.
* **Express Gratitude:** Thank the recorded providers ("the Cast") for their contribution to the session.
* **Set the Stage:**
  * Reaffirm the learning-focused goal of video review.
  * Briefly describe the case and any essential contextual information.

**Facilitating the Discussion**

* **Preserve a Safe Space:** Actively guide the conversation, ensuring a respectful and constructive tone. Be prepared to intervene if feedback rules are violated.
* **Encourage Participation:** Strive to include everyone in the discussion by posing thoughtful questions about their perspectives.

**Closing the Session**

* **Summary and Takeaways:** Dedicate the final 5 minutes to:
  * Summarizing key discussion themes
  * Inviting final comments from participants
  * Formulating actionable takeaways with the question, "What can we conclude from this session?"

**The Chair's Core Responsibility:** Throughout the entire process, your primary role is to protect the safe learning environment you've established.

## Practical tips

* **The Foundation of Success:** Emphasize that building a safe, supportive learning environment is the fundamental prerequisite for effective video review. Acknowledge that this takes ongoing effort.
* **Inclusivity:** Encourage the participation of all providers involved in hands-on care. Diverse perspectives enrich the learning experience.
* **Reinforce Rules & Goals:** Before each session, reiterate:
  * **Purpose of Video Review:** Collaborative learning, not judgment.
  * **Perfection vs. Growth:** The focus is on understanding team dynamics in context, not achieving flawlessness.
  * **Feedback Rules:** Remind everyone to be specific, focus on observable behaviors, and avoid personalization or judgment.

It can be helpful to use **feedback rules**:
