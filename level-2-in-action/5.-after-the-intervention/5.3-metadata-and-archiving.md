# 5.3 Metadata and Archiving

## Metadata and Archiving: Organizing videos for retrieval and long-term use.

* Metadata: Assign descriptive metadata to each recording (e.g., procedure type, date, primary providers involved, patient ID if relevant). This makes searching easier.
* Consistent File Naming: Establish a clear file naming convention to facilitate retrieval within your storage system.
* Archiving Strategy: Develop a long-term archiving plan addressing how long to retain recordings based on their learning potential and any regulatory requirements.
