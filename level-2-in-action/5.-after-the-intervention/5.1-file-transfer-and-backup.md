# 5.1 File Transfer and Backup

## File Transfer and Backup: Secure storage and redundancy for protecting recordings.

* Secure Transfer: If possible, avoid transferring files using removable media (USB drives). Use secure, encrypted network transfer protocols approved by your institution.
* Centralized Storage: Store video files in a designated, protected location on your hospital network with appropriate access controls.
* Redundant Backups: Maintain multiple backups (e.g., on-site and cloud-based) to safeguard against data loss due to hardware failure or unforeseen events.
* Encryption: Use strong encryption to protect both stored video files and those in transit, especially if they include potentially identifiable patient information.
