# 5.2 Simple Video Editing

## Simple Video Editing: Basic editing for trimming, annotations, or de-identifying videos.

* Software Options: Many simple-to-use video editing tools are available. Choose one that aligns with your institution's security and IT guidelines.
* Trimming: Edit out unnecessary start/end segments to focus review sessions on the core procedure.
* Annotations: Add text overlays (e.g., timestamps, clarifications) to highlight specific moments or provide additional context.
* De-identification: Consider blurring faces or modifying voices if patient privacy is a concern, particularly for broader use outside the immediate review team. Of course, consent is always necessary.
