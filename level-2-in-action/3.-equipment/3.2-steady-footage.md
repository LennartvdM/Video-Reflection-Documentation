# 3.2 Steady Footage

Camera shake can significantly detract from the value of video review in healthcare. Even when using mobile devices, a few simple techniques can greatly improve stability and clarity:

**Tripods and Mounts:**

* Portable Tripods: Lightweight, foldable tripods offer quick setup and adaptable positioning for mobile cameras or smartphones.
* Wall or Ceiling Mounts: In designated procedure rooms, secure mounts provide a fixed camera perspective with minimal shake.

**Stabilizing Techniques:**

* Two-Handed Grip: When handheld filming is necessary, use a firm two-handed grip to reduce accidental movements.
* Body Positioning: Bracing your elbows against your body or leaning against a stable surface can offer increased support.
* Smooth and Controlled Movement: When repositioning the camera, focus on slow, deliberate movements to avoid sudden jerks or blurry footage.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Image Stabilization Features: Some cameras and smartphones have built-in stabilization which can minimize minor shake.
* Supplementing with Fixed Cameras: A fixed camera provides a baseline stable image, even if other recordings are less steady.

Emphasis: While professional stabilization equipment exists, implementing these simple techniques can significantly improve the quality and utility of your video review in emergency and intensive care settings.
