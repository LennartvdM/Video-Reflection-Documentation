# Mobile cameras

Mobile cameras offer versatility and adaptability for recording procedures in emergency and intensive care settings. Here's a breakdown of their advantages, limitations, and how to optimize their use:

* Adaptability: Mounted on tripods or carts, mobile cameras can be quickly repositioned to capture different angles or focus on unexpected events with greater ease than fixed setups.
* Detail Focus: They can zoom in on specific actions, providing close-up views for assessing technique or analyzing intricate details in procedures.
* Flexibility in Unexpected Locations: Mobile cameras are ideal for recording in less predictable environments or during patient transport, where fixed cameras may not be present.

<mark style="color:red;">**Cons:**</mark>

* Operator Required: They often necessitate a dedicated team member to operate and reposition the camera, potentially increasing workload during critical moments.
* Potential Obtrusiveness: Depending on the size and design, mobile cameras could be more noticeable than fixed cameras, potentially influencing staff behavior or impacting the care environment.
* Variable Perspective: Without careful planning, mobile camera footage might lack the consistent viewpoint offered by a fixed camera, making comparisons between recordings more difficult.

* Procedure Type: For technical skill assessment, position the camera to capture a clear view of the relevant area and provider's hands.
* Avoiding Obstructions: Ensure the camera's line of sight is unobstructed by equipment or other staff members.
* Supplementing Fixed Cameras: If available, use mobile cameras in conjunction with fixed cameras to provide both a wide-angle overview and close-up perspectives.

**Additional Notes:**

* Stabilizing the Image: Tripods and wheeled carts with smooth movement can help minimize camera shake and improve footage quality.
* Operator Training: Even brief training on operating the camera and positioning it effectively can significantly enhance the value of the recordings.

Ultimately, mobile cameras excel in situations where flexibility and adaptability outweigh the need for a predictable, wide-angle view. They are particularly useful for detailed skill analysis or when recording in unpredictable locations.
