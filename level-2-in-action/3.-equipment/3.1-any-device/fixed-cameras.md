# Fixed cameras

Fixed cameras offer a stable, consistent perspective for video review in emergency and intensive care settings. Here's a breakdown of their advantages, limitations, and how to optimize their placement:

<mark style="color:green;">**Pros:**</mark>

* Wide-Angle View: Often mounted overhead or on walls, fixed cameras can capture the entire scene, providing crucial context for understanding teamwork, workflow, and the overall environment in which care is delivered.
* Unobtrusive: Once installed, they require minimal intervention, reducing disruptions for staff and potentially minimizing the 'observer effect' compared to handheld devices.
* Predictable Perspective: With a fixed field of view, reviewers know exactly what they are seeing, aiding in comparisons across multiple recordings of similar procedures.

<mark style="color:red;">**Cons:**</mark>

* Limited Adaptability: They cannot easily adjust to unexpected events or focus on specific details that might emerge during a procedure.
* Potential Blind Spots: Room configuration may create areas that are obscured from the camera's view.
* Cost and Installation: Depending on desired quality, fixed cameras can be a more expensive initial investment and may require specialized installation.

* Procedure Area: Prioritize areas where complex procedures frequently occur (e.g., trauma bays, resuscitation rooms, specific ICU beds).
* Overhead vs. Wall-Mounted: Overhead offers a 'bird's eye view' ideal for teamwork analysis, while wall-mounted cameras might be better if specific hands-on techniques are the focus.
* Multiple Angles: If resources allow, multiple fixed cameras provide a more comprehensive picture of events.

**Additional Notes:**

* Combining Fixed and Mobile: Fixed cameras provide a baseline perspective, which can be supplemented with strategically deployed mobile cameras as needed.
* Integrating with Other Data: Ideally, fixed camera recordings can be time-synced with patient monitoring data, offering a powerful tool for analysis.

Ultimately, the value of fixed cameras depends on their strategic positioning and if their predictable, wide-angle view aligns with your video review goals.
