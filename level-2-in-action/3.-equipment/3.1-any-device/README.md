# 3.1 Any Device

Emergency and intensive care environments are dynamic and unpredictable. While specialized recording equipment can be ideal, the ability to capture critical moments for review often depends on adaptability and accessibility. Prioritizing device flexibility allows for timely recording, maximizing learning opportunities:

* **Readily Available Devices:** Smartphones, tablets, and even existing patient monitoring systems often have recording capabilities. These readily available tools enable quick action when unexpected or high-stakes events occur.
* **Workflow Integration:** Using familiar devices streamlines the recording process, minimizing disruptions to critical care delivery and reducing stress for providers.
* **Adapting to Space Constraints:** Emergency situations can arise in varied locations with limited space. Flexible device options can be adapted to the environment, ensuring that valuable perspectives are captured.
* **Focus on Content, Not Just Quality:** While optimal video quality is desirable, the primary goal in emergent settings is to capture the content â€“ the actions, communication, and decision-making processes. This data holds immense value for reflection and improvement, even if the image resolution is not perfect.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Security and Privacy:** Ensure chosen devices are compliant with hospital policies for data security and patient privacy. Establish clear protocols for transfer, storage, and deletion of recordings.
* **Technical Aspects:** Brief training for staff on basic recording functions of available devices helps optimize capture quality and smooth workflow.

**Emphasis:** While specialized equipment offers advantages, prioritizing device flexibility empowers providers to record valuable learning experiences in the often-unpredictable world of emergency and intensive care.

## Options:

* [**Fixed Cameras:**](fixed-cameras.md) Strategically installed in procedure rooms or resuscitation bays offer overhead or wide-angle views, capturing the broader context of complex events. Ideal for established workflows with predictable patient positioning.
* [**Mobile Cameras**](mobile-cameras.md)**:** Mounted on tripods or carts, these provide adaptable perspectives, easily moved to different locations or to focus on specific actions during unexpected events.
* [**Wearable Cameras:**](wearable-cameras.md) Body-worn or head-mounted devices provide a first-person view of care, valuable for skill assessment and hands-on training. Useful for capturing detailed techniques and interactions.
* [**Patient Monitoring Systems**](patient-monitoring-systems.md)**:** Some existing monitoring systems have recording capabilities. These can supplement other views, potentially integrating video with vital signs and other physiological data for comprehensive analysis.
* [<mark style="color:blue;">**Motion-detecting cameras**</mark>](motion-detecting-cameras.md)<mark style="color:blue;">**:**</mark> Motion-detecting cameras streamline medical procedure recording, automatically capturing unexpected events.
