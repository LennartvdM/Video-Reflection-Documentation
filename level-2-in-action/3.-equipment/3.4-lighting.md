# 3.4 Lighting

Natural light can offer excellent illumination for video but requires some consideration to achieve optimal results in healthcare settings. Here's how to make it work:

**Assess and Adapt:**

* Room Orientation: Identify rooms with windows that offer ample natural light.
* Combining Light Sources: Natural light can often be effectively supplemented with existing room lighting. Experiment with blending them for the best results.

**Post-Production Editing:**

* Color Correction: Video editing software offers tools to adjust white balance and correct for shifts in color temperature caused by changes in natural light.
* Brightness and Contrast: Adjust these settings to compensate for potential over or underexposure in your footage.

Emphasis: Natural light can be a valuable asset for medical video recording. Understanding how to work with it effectively, combined with basic post-production editing, allows you to achieve clear, well-lit footage.
