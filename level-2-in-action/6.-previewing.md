# 6. Previewing

Previewing recorded procedures before in-depth review maximizes learning potential and is essential for the safe learning environment. Here's how to strategically pre-screen medical videos:

**Why Preview?**

* Focus Review Sessions: Identify segments most relevant to your learning goals (technical skills, communication, decision-making, etc.).
* Provider Engagement: Previews allow recorded providers to highlight areas they are most interested in discussing.
* Request Plenary Use Permission: Obtain explicit permission from the team to utilize the video and accompanying insights during the larger plenary review session.

**Questions for Video-Assisted Debriefing**

**Opening Observation:**

* "As you watch the video, what initial details and actions stand out to you?"

**Positive Focus:**

* "What aspects of the procedure went particularly well?"

**Opportunities for Improvement:**

* "Are there areas where you see potential for a different approach or refinement?"
* "What elements, if any, could be further improved?"

**Retrospective Insights:**

* "Did the video reveal anything you didn't consciously notice during the procedure?"

**Contextual Awareness:**

* "Are there factors not visible in the video (like ward stress, time of day, etc.) that influenced the procedure and should be considered?"

**Collaborative Support:**

* "Do you have specific questions or areas where you'd like feedback from colleagues during the plenary session?"

**Consent:**

* "Do you consent to the use of this video and our discussion in the plenary video review session?"
