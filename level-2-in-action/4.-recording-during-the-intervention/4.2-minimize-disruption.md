**Minimize Disruption: Balancing recording needs with maintaining a natural workflow.**

* Pre-procedure setup: Prepare equipment in advance whenever possible.
* Dedicated Operator: If possible, assign a team member to manage the camera, freeing others to focus on patient care.
* Streamlined Workflow: Integrate recording into existing procedures where feasible.
