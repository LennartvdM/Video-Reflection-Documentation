# 4.5 Communication During recording

**5.5 Communication During Recording: How to acknowledge recording without impacting the patient experience.**

* Pre-procedure Announcement: A brief, clear statement before the procedure informs everyone (including patients if conscious) that recording is in progress.
* Minimize Verbal Cues: Avoid unnecessary commentary during recording; focus on essential communication related to patient care.
* Patient-Centered Approach: Prioritize patient comfort and privacy. If the patient expresses concern, address it sensitively or potentially stop recording if appropriate.
