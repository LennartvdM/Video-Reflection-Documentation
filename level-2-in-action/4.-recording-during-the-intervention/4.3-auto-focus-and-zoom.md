# 4.3 Auto-Focus and Zoom

**Auto-focus and Zoom: When and how to use these features effectively.**

* Auto-focus: Useful for maintaining focus on moving subjects, but be aware of potential distraction if it hunts significantly.
* Zoom: Best for planned close-ups â€“ pre-set or have a dedicated operator make adjustments. Avoid excessive zooming during a procedure, as it can disorient viewers.
