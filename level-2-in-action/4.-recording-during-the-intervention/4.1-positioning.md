# 4.1 Positioning

#### **Positioning: Optimal camera angles and placement for different procedures.**

* Overhead: Ceiling or wall-mounted fixed cameras provide a wide view for team dynamics and room layout analysis (e.g., trauma resuscitation).
* Close-up: Mobile or wearable cameras offer detailed views for skill analysis (e.g., suturing techniques, intubation).
* Multiple Angles: Consider combining perspectives to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the procedure.
