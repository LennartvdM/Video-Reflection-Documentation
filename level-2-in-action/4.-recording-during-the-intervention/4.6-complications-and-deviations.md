# 4.6 Complications and Deviations

**Handling Complications or Deviations: How to navigate unexpected events while recording.**

* Documentation Goal: Remember, recordings capture real-world care, including complications. This data is valuable for analysis and improvement. Complications have to be reported regardless of wheter a video has been made.
* Don't Stop Prematurely or start too late: Unless necessary for patient safety, continue recording to document the response and management of the event, including the preparation and time-out.
* Post-Event Review: Use unforeseen events as especially rich learning opportunities in video review sessions.
