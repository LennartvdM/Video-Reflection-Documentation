# Introduction: Taking reflection in medical care to the next level

**Setting the stage**

In the rapid world of modern medicine, time is scarce, and medical and nursing staff are already overwhelmed. Medical procedures that are performed in a critical setting, such as in intensive or emergency care, require a dynamic interaction between healthcare providers, technical resources and the patient and setting. For example:

The timely treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction timely with thrombolysis is essential for a good prognosis.

* A patient on the ICU might suffer from respiratory distress, leading to impending exhaustion and requires endotracheal intubation.
* When a premature baby is born, an whole medical team is needed for the stabilisation of the baby, providing the infant with respiratory support.
* Adding more tasks might seem implausible. But there's an opportunity worth exploring that can help improve care — video review of medical procedures.&#x20;

**Complexity is not often evaluated**

In emergency or intensive care, it is difficult to reflect on critical or complex moments, even though these are highly influential for patient outcomes. First, there are aspects that are not reflected upon because they are forgotten, or simply go unnoticed by the medical staff. So far, the most used method for reflection is debriefing or evaluation of a situation. However, incomplete documentation and recall bias limits the value of this type of reflection. A “near miss” event may go unnoticed, or prove challenging to detect in medical records. Aspects influencing resilience and teamwork are not documented. Second, providers do not have the opportunity to learn from variety in care, as they often don’t watch their colleagues’ performance of procedures, especially when they are more experienced. So these differences in practice, which consequently give opportunity for learning, are missed.

**Solution**

Recording and reviewing medical procedures empowers providers to reflect on critical care moments in full transparency and to learn from each other. Video review gives medical providers the opportunity to gain completely new insights on how to improve care.

The _Neoflix_ toolbox supports medical teams in implementing and using video review in a safe and effective way:

* How to implement video review and introduce _Neoflix_ to your team;
* How to use video review, while keeping it safe and effective;
* How to use video review to connect with centers worldwide

Surprisingly, the effort isn't as daunting as it seems. With modern tech, capturing footage is accessible. Whether using a smartphone or dedicated equipment like eye-tracking glasses or a fixed camera, the journey is smoother than expected. Concerns about privacy and time contraints can be managed with planning and team involvement.

Think of this as an asset, not a burden. Amidst the grind, video review offers a rare chance to shape future medicine, educate upcoming professionals, and refine team collaboration. It balances your present demands with a lasting impact.
