# 3.1 Positioning

Strategic positioning of your recording equipment is paramount when capturing surgical procedures. Place your recording device in a location that offers an unobstructed view of the surgical field, ensuring that important surgical actions and anatomical landmarks are clearly visible. Experiment with angles to capture the procedure comprehensively, enabling viewers to grasp the intricate details of each step.

When positioning the camera, consider the surgeon's perspective and movements. Avoid obstructing the surgical team's line of sight or impeding their movements. By positioning the camera thoughtfully, you provide viewers with a valuable learning tool that offers insights into the surgical process from various angles.
