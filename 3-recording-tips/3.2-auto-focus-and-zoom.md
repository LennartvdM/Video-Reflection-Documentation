# 3.2 Auto-Focus and Zoom

Auto-focus can be a valuable ally in maintaining clarity during dynamic surgical procedures. Utilize your device's auto-focus feature to keep the surgical field sharp and detailed throughout the recording. However, be cautious of abrupt focus adjustments that might occur due to changes in the surgical environment or camera positioning.

When using zoom, do so deliberately and smoothly to emphasize crucial details without compromising overall clarity. A controlled zooming approach ensures that viewers can follow the procedure's progression while appreciating critical actions up close.
