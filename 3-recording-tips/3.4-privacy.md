# 3.4 Privacy

Throughout the recording process, prioritize patient privacy and confidentiality. Concentrate solely on the surgery and exclude any patient identifiers, personal data, or unrelated content from the footage. Adhere to patient consent guidelines and ensure sensitive information remains concealed.

Before using the footage for educational purposes, review the content to confirm patient privacy is protected. Blur or remove any identifiable information to prevent inadvertent disclosures. By upholding patient privacy, you contribute to the responsible use of recorded surgical footage, fostering an ethical and educational environment.
