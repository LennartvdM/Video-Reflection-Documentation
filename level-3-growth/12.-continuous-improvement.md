# 12. Continuous Improvement

## Debriefing and Continuous Improvement

Regularly organized video review sessions, with findings that are translated into action, will ultimately result in a continuous learning and improvement process within your unit. However, the process itself must continually evolve. Here are key considerations:

### Tracking Progress Over Time

* Choose meaningful metrics: Align these with your institution's priorities – they might include the number of changes you made to protocols, best practices you learned from, adjustments you made to training progams or education, or research initiatieves.&#x20;
* Collect provider perspective data: Assess the pre-video-review state to accurately measure the impact of your video review program, and evaluate the safe learning environment.&#x20;
* Ongoing Evaluation: Periodically review your video review program with your pioneer team, to identify trends, celebrate successes, and refine your video review program as needed. Make sure to celebrate successes with your team as well.&#x20;

### Evolving Your Video Review: The Power of Team Input

Imagine your video review program as a growing, adaptable tool. To wield it effectively, you must listen closely to those using it – your team. Here's how to make it a collaborative, evolving process:

* Ask for Input: "What other procedures would you find helpful to record? Are there specific aspects of care you'd like to analyze in more detail?"
* Challenge Camera Angles: Could repositioning offer new glimpses into teamwork dynamics, patient experiences, or workflow challenges?
* Explore Diverse Perspectives:
  * Patient View: What might be learned about communication effectiveness and patient needs from this unique angle?
  * Nurse-Focused: Can this viewpoint highlight teamwork patterns or opportunities to optimize efficiency?
* Actively solicit your team's ideas. By treating video review as a collaborative tool shaped by their needs and insights, it stays fresh, relevant, and genuinely drives continuous improvement.

Video review is a dynamic tool. Through open communication, tracking progress, responsible sharing, a focus on inclusivity, and a commitment to continuous improvement, you maximize its benefits for your team and ultimately enhance the quality of patient care.
