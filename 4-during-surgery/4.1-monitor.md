# 4.1 Monitor

Designate a team member to actively monitor the recording equipment throughout the surgery. Their role includes ensuring that the recording is functioning smoothly, the camera angle remains optimal, and no technical issues disrupt the process. Having a dedicated monitor mitigates the risk of missing crucial moments and contributes to the overall quality of the recorded footage.\

Consistent monitoring allows you to make real-time adjustments during the surgery. Periodically check the focus of the footage and refine it as necessary to maintain clear visuals. Additionally, ensure that your device has sufficient storage space and battery power to capture the entirety of the surgical procedure, reducing the likelihood of interruptions that could impact the educational value of the recording.
