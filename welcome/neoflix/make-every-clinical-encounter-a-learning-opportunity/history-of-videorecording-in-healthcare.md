## History of Video Recording and Reviewing in Healthcare

While the use of video review in healthcare feels like a recent phenomenon, its roots stretch back several decades. Here's a look at its evolution:

### Early Pioneers:

* 1960s/70s: Pioneering center used closed-circuit television to record procedures for immediate self-review and teaching purposes within emergency medical care.
  * Peltier LF, Geertsma RH, Youmans RL. Television videotape recording: an adjunct in teaching emergency medical care. Surgery. 1969;66(1):233-6.
  * Focus on Technical Skills: Initial use primarily centered on assessing individual surgical technique and providing targeted feedback.
  * Equipment Challenges: Bulky equipment and limited storage options posed early barriers to widespread adoption.

### Technology Opens Doors:

* 1980s/90s: Advances in video recording, storage, and software made the system more portable and user-friendly.
* Expanding Focus: Applications broadened to include communication and teamwork analysis, moving beyond sole technical assessment.

### Digital and Networked Era:

* 2000s: The shift to digital recording and networked systems greatly enhanced storage capacity and ease of access for review.
* Widespread Interest: Video review began gaining popularity across various medical specialties beyond surgery.
  * Carbine DN, Finer NN, Knodel E, Rich W. Video recording as a means of evaluating neonatal resuscitation performance. Pediatrics. 2000; 106(4):654-8.
* Specialization: Dedicated video capture systems designed for specific healthcare settings appeared.

### Recent Innovations:

* 2010s - Present: Advancements in mobile cameras, wearable devices, and AI-assisted analysis expand the possibilities of video review:
  * Damji O, Lee-Nobbee P, Borkenhagen D, Cheng A. Analysis of eye-tracking behaviours in a pediatric trauma simulation. CJEM. (2019) 21:138â€“40. doi: 10.1017/ cem.2018.450
  * Democratization of Recording: Providers easily capture procedures with readily available technology.
    * Focus on Workflow Integration: Emphasis on seamless [recording and review processes within existing clinical systems.](https://app.gitbook.com/s/MdMcavmFWyJ3gxr9PXYq/summaries-articles/nog-niet-online-2.-implementing-and-re-defining-video-review)
    * Patient-Centric Uses: Exploration of uses like recording consent conversations and enhancing patient education.

### The Future is Collaborative:

Video review in healthcare has journeyed from a tool for individual skill analysis to a multifaceted approach driving continuous quality improvement. Emerging trends point towards increased sharing of knowledge across institutions, a greater focus on patient-provider interactions, and the integration of video data with other healthcare analytics for even deeper insights.
