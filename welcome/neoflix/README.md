Video review offers a powerful tool for healthcare professionals seeking to enhance their practice, foster a culture of continuous learning, and ultimately improve clinical care. Don't let the idea of high-stakes recordings hold you back. Start with a low-pressure approach:

* **Routine Procedures:** Focus on a familiar task. Even simple activities can reveal patterns, habits, and areas for refinement upon review.
* **Consent & Openness:** Building trust is essential for successful video review. Obtain informed consent from providers, emphasizing the focus on collaborative learning rather than individual critique. Establish secure protocols for handling sensitive video data, and offer the option for footage removal after review to foster trust and open participation.

With even a short test recording, you'll be surprised at what you might discover. Are you ready to unlock the potential of video review? Our [Quick-Start guide](../quick-start/) will equip you with the essentials. But first let's dive into why video review is essential for your medical team.&#x20;
