# 1.3 Choose Cases:

When selecting cases for recording, prioritize those that hold significant educational value. Opt for procedures that showcase innovative techniques, challenging scenarios, or valuable learning points. Simultaneously, respect patient privacy and dignity by avoiding cases that might compromise confidentiality. By thoughtfully choosing cases, you contribute to a pool of educational resources that benefit both medical professionals and patients.
