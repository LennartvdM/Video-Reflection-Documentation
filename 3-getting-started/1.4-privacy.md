# 1.4 Privacy

Uphold patient confidentiality and privacy by refraining from capturing any patient identifiers or sensitive information without proper authorization. Your focus should remain on the surgical procedure itself, avoiding incidental details that could compromise patient privacy. By prioritizing patient confidentiality, you contribute to maintaining trust within the medical community and among patients seeking care.
