# 1.1 Obtain Consent

Before recording any surgical procedure, it's essential to obtain explicit consent from the patient. Explain to them the purpose of recording, how the footage will be used (such as for educational purposes), and assure them that their identity will be protected. Ensure that the patient fully understands and agrees to the recording.
