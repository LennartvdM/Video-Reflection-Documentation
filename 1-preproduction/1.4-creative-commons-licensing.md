Under a CC license, users of your footage must credit you as the creator. This ensures respect for your work and its intended purpose of advancing medical education.

These licenses are flexible, allowing you to decide the permissions. You can permit derivative works or limit usage to non-commercial contexts. This empowers you to shape how your expertise benefits others while aligning with your values.

By embracing Creative Commons, you contribute to the medical community while retaining control over your work. This addresses concerns about commercial exploitation and ensures your contribution remains focused on its educational purpose.\
