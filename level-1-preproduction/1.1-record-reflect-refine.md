# 1.1 Record, reflect, refine

We understand that adding anything to the already overloaded schedules of healthcare professionals can seem counterintuitive. The key to video reviewing is that, while it requires an initial investment, it ultimately unburdens processes, creates efficiencies, and offers much-needed breathing room in the long run.

**How it works**

* Learning from the past to improving in the Future: Video review enables in-depth analysis, helping you recognize patterns. This translates to a better understanding of what works well, what needs improvement, and the ability to anticipate future challenges.
* Exposing Hidden Time-Sinks: Video reveals the often-invisible inefficiencies within procedures and team interactions. By identifying these areas, you streamline processes and reclaim precious time.
* Sharing knowledge: through video review, medical teams can see how their colleagues work, enabling them to learn from each other in full transparancy.&#x20;
