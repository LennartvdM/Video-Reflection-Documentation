# 1.5.2 Simple: Recording

When recording procedures on your unit, consider data storage:

\-> Are recordings stored (de-identified)?

\-> Where is data stored?

\-> How is data protected?

\-> Who has access?

\-> For which period is data stored?

\-> Can recordings be claimed for medicolegal purposes?

{% hint style="info" %}
When recordings are used solely for quality assurance purposes, recordings may be legally protected. Consider within your own context and local regulations.&#x20;

So far, no legal cases have been reported by NICU's. The NICU of the LUMC has implemented recording and reviewing of neonatal stabilization since 2014. It is not yet clear if recordings can be used in court. (Den boer et al 2018)

When choosing your recording equipment, keep it simple and work with what you have available on your department. Later on, you could always choose to add respiratory function monitoring or purchase more expensive recording equipment. Here are a few options:

{% tab title="GoPro" %}
GoPro cameras are renowned for their durability and rugged design, making them ideal for active use in challenging medical environments. Their wide-angle capabilities offer a distinct advantage by capturing a broader field of view, allowing viewers to gain a comprehensive understanding. Various accessories provide versatile mounting options, ensuring flexibility in capturing different angles and perspectives.

Due to the waterproof housing, audio quality may suffer, affecting the ability to capture clear and nuanced audio alongside the video recording. To enhance audio quality, explore the option of using an external microphone that can capture sound more accurately.

<mark style="color:green;">**Pros:**</mark>

* **Durability:** Designed for active use, GoPros are rugged and resilient.
* **Wide-Angle:** GoPros capture a broad field of view, showcasing more of the surgical area.
* **Waterproof:** Their waterproof design withstands sterilization methods involving moisture.
* **Mounting Options:** Accessories allow versatile mounting in various angles.

<mark style="color:red;">**Cons:**</mark>

* **Fixed Focus:** GoPros may lack adjustable focus settings, affecting the depth of field.
* **Battery Life:** Depending on settings, battery life may be limited during extended procedures.
* **Limited Audio:** Audio quality may be compromised due to the waterproof housing.

{% tab title="Smartphone/tablet" %}
Smartphones have become nearly ubiquitous, eliminating the need for additional recording equipment. Their portability is a key advantage, allowing providers to quickly position the device for optimal recording angles. The user-friendly interfaces of smartphones make setup and recording intuitive, even for those less familiar with advanced camera equipment. Furthermore, modern smartphones are equipped with high-quality cameras that deliver clear and detailed visuals, enabling the capture of intricate surgical details for educational purposes.

Despite their convenience, smartphones have limitations. Manual controls for adjusting exposure and focus might be restricted compared to dedicated cameras, which can affect the quality of recorded footage in challenging lighting conditions. Extensive recording sessions, especially during lengthy procedures, can drain the smartphone's battery rapidly, necessitating careful battery management or backup power solutions. Additionally, recording handheld may lead to shaky footage, impacting the overall viewing experience for those who engage with the content.

To address stability issues during longer recording sessions, consider using a tripod or stabilizer to ensure steady footage. Activate privacy settings to prevent calls or notifications from disrupting the recording process.&#x20;

Lastly, bear in mind that the smartphone should not be for personal use, to avoid data leakage.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**Pros:**</mark>

* **Ubiquitous:** Almost universally owned, smartphones eliminate the need for additional equipment.
* **Portability:** Their small size and weight make them easy to carry and position.
* **User-Friendly:** Familiar interfaces make setup and recording intuitive for most users.
* **High-Quality Cameras:** Modern smartphones boast advanced camera technology for clear visuals.

<mark style="color:red;">**Cons:**</mark>

* **Limited Features:** Manual settings for exposure and focus may be restricted compared to dedicated cameras.
* **Battery Life:** Extensive recording sessions can deplete the battery rapidly, necessitating management.
* **Stabilization:** Handheld recording can introduce shaky footage, impacting viewing quality.
* **Privacy:** it could appear unprofessional to record procedures with a phone.&#x20;

{% tab title="Eye-tracking glasses" %}
Eye-tracking glasses are glasses with a build in camera that the provider an put on. The glasses record a detailed first-person perspective, so you can stand back while observing on a screen in real-time and collecting quality data.

Eye-tracking glasses are also used for research purposes, such as obtaining data on what a person focuses on during the recording.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**Pros:**</mark>

* **Point-of-view recording:** Especially when the procedure can't be visualized from afar, eye-tracking glasses allow for visualization of small procedures.&#x20;
* **Portability:** They are positioned on the head, so you can record a procedure hands-free.
* **High-Quality Cameras:** Eye-tracking glasses boast advanced camera technology for clear visuals.

<mark style="color:red;">**Cons:**</mark>

* **Less user-friendly:** these glasses can be difficult to activate with multiple steps, which is not preferable in an emergency situation.&#x20;
* **Battery Life:** Extensive recording sessions can deplete the battery, necessitating management.
* **Stabilization:** Eye-tracking can introduce shaky footage, impacting viewing quality.
* **Price:** eye-tracking glasses are often quite expensive, ranging from 10.000 - 20.000

{% tab title="Respiratory function monitoring" %}
<mark style="color:green;">**Pros:**</mark>

* **Gives information on the infant's condition:**&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">**Cons:**</mark>

* **You need to be able to synchronise different video's into one.**&#x20;
* **Not every unit uses RFM monitoring.**&#x20;
