# 1.5.1 Safe: Obtaining consent

As video review has been used in several domains of health care, e.g. patient care, quality improvement, research and education, its use is also complicated by conflicting issues and requirements of each of these domains. The different stakeholders and ethical values surrounding video review could withhold other centers from implementing it.&#x20;

Off note, if an adverse event occurs during an intervention, this has to be reported regardless of whether a video has been made or not. Although recordings used for quality improvement are often protected by law, it is not clear if they can be used as evidence in court. Medicolegal problems with video recording have so far not been reported, nor did we encounter this since we started video review in 2014.

Here you can find different approaches for patient and provider consent. Choose one that is suitable for your department and patient population and discuss with your legal department and management. Consider the following questions:

**Patient consent**

\-> When and how are patients informed?

\-> Should patients explicitly consent?&#x20;

\-> Can patients request to delete recordings?

\-> Who can be contacted in case of questions?

\-> Will recordings be shared with patients?

{% hint style="info" %}
Research on the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), showed that sharing recordings of neonatal stabilization with parents, can be beneficial for parents and their coping. Parents of infants admitted to the NICU of the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), reviewed recordings and reported that they appreciated it and doing so, made them less likely to hold providers responsible for medical malpractice (den Boer et al. 2021).

**Provider consent**

\-> When and how are providers informed?

\-> Should providers explicitly consent?

\-> Can individual providers refuse recording or reviewing?&#x20;

**Type of videos**

* Videos of neonatal stabilization
  * Idenfiable recordings
  * Unidentifiable recordings
* Video of procedures on the NICU, such as endotracheal intubation, surfactant administration, sterile procedures etc.&#x20;
  * Identifiable recordings

**Patient consent**

Unidentifiable videos of neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room (in which the neonate and hands of the providers were visible) were part of the medical record of the patient and were stored on protected servers. All neonatal resuscitations are recorded as part of standard care on our NICU. Postnatally, parents can request to view the video with a staff member and request a copy. The non-anonymous audio-visual videos of neonatal resuscitations and interventions on the NICU are used for quality improvement only. No patient consent is asked before recording. However, if parents are visible in a recording, they are asked for consent for use of the video in the video review session.&#x20;

**Provider consent**

Consent from providers was obtained before any identifiable recording. When someone was accidentally captured on film without permission, their permission was sought afterwards. The recordings were stored on protected servers and only designated team members of the study group had access to the recordings. All providers of the NICU-team were informed about implementation of video review beforehand and were given the opportunity to opt out of (identifiable) recordings of interventions. It was emphasized that recording an intervention should remain voluntary. If team members wanted to opt-out, before or after a recording had been made, a dedicated member of the study group could always be approached. Identifiable recordings were deleted after the study period.

* You are able to record all procedures, even the most emergent ones where it would not have been possible to obtain consent.&#x20;
* The providers have the opportunity to say no to recording their procedures.&#x20;
* Whether a provider is recorded and/or used for video review, lies completely within their own control.&#x20;
* The unidentifiable recordings of stabilization can be shown to parents, as part of family-centered care.&#x20;

* Impairment of privacy of patients
* Identifiable recordings are deleted after the project, so further use for research is not possible
* By making recording voluntary, not every procedure will be recorded standardly
