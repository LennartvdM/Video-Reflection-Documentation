# 1.4.3 Small: Capture Audio

**The Value and Complexities of Audio in Video Review**

Audio plays a crucial role in video review for healthcare. It enriches the learning experience by capturing elements that visuals alone cannot:

* **Verbal Communication:** Reveals nuances of team interactions, provider-patient dialogue, and decision-making processes.
* **Patient Reactions:** Captures subtle but important patient sounds like breathing patterns.

However, audio also raises significant privacy concerns:

* **Identifiable Information:** Voices and background conversations can easily reveal patient and provider identities.
* **Sensitive Discussions:** Recordings may capture confidential diagnoses, family dynamics, or ethically complex situations.

**Balancing Benefits and Privacy**

* **Selective Audio Recording:** Consider recording audio only when essential for learning objectives and delete it afterwards if not strictly necessary.
* **De-identification:** If possible, explore audio de-identification techniques (e.g., voice modulation) while preserving clinically relevant information.
* **Strict Consent:** Obtain explicit consent from providers for audio recording, especially when identifiable.

**Strategic Implementation: Start Small, Scale Thoughtfully**

As with any new technology, starting small with video review allows you to:

* **Focus on Buy-In:** Build trust among providers and patients by starting with less sensitive procedures and clear communication about audio usage.
* **Refine Processes:** Develop robust protocols for audio recording, storage, management, and deletion.
* **Assess Value:** Evaluate the added benefits of audio against logistical and ethical considerations.

**Remember, a phased approach empowers you to make informed decisions about expanding your project while prioritizing patient and provider privacy alongside educational gains.**

Keep in mind that when recording in a room with a lot of background noise (ventilators, monitoring etc) you might need an additional microphone to reduce background noise.&#x20;
