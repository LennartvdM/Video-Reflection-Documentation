# 1.4.2 Simple: Recording

**Key Considerations:**

* **Storage:**
  * **De-identification:** Are patient and provider identifiers removed to protect privacy?
  * **Location:** Where will recordings be stored (local server, cloud-based, etc.)?
* **Protection:**
  * **Encryption:** Are recordings deidentified when they are stored?
  * **Access Control:** Implement strict access control measures (role-based permissions, audit logs)
* **Retention:**
  * **Timeframe:** Define a clear data retention policy based on your purposes and local regulations.

**Legal Context:**

* **Quality Assurance Protection:** Explore if local laws offer protection for recordings marked for quality improvement purposes.
* **Case Law:** Stay informed about emerging legal precedents related to the use of medical video recordings in court cases.

{% hint style="info" %}
So far, no legal cases have been reported by NICU's. The NICU of the LUMC has implemented recording and reviewing of neonatal stabilization since 2014 and has not encountered any medicolegal issues. It is not yet clear if recordings can be used in court. (Den boer et al 2018)
{% endhint %}

**Recording Equipment Selection:**

* **Simplicity First:** Start with readily available technology (smartphones, tablets, basic cameras) for initial setup.
* **Later Upgrades:** As your program matures, consider incorporating:
  * **Respiratory Monitors:** If applicable, add devices to capture respiratory data alongside video
  * **Specialized Equipment:** Explore high-end options for image quality, multiple angles, etc.

Here are a few options:

{% tab title="GoPro" %}
GoPro cameras are renowned for their durability and rugged design, making them ideal for active use in challenging medical environments. Their wide-angle capabilities offer a distinct advantage by capturing a broader field of view, allowing viewers to gain a comprehensive understanding. Various accessories provide versatile mounting options, ensuring flexibility in capturing different angles and perspectives.

Due to the waterproof housing, audio quality may suffer, affecting the ability to capture clear and nuanced audio alongside the video recording. To enhance audio quality, explore the option of using an external microphone that can capture sound more accurately.

<mark style="color:green;">**Pros:**</mark>

* **Durability:** Designed for active use, GoPros are rugged and resilient.
* **Wide-Angle:** GoPros capture a broad field of view, showcasing more of the surgical area.
* **Waterproof:** Their waterproof design withstands sterilization methods involving moisture.
* **Mounting Options:** Accessories allow versatile mounting in various angles.

<mark style="color:red;">**Cons:**</mark>

* **Fixed Focus:** GoPros may lack adjustable focus settings, affecting the depth of field.
* **Battery Life:** Depending on settings, battery life may be limited during extended procedures.
* **Limited Audio:** Audio quality may be compromised due to the waterproof housing.

{% tab title="Smartphone/tablet" %}
Smartphones have become nearly ubiquitous, eliminating the need for additional recording equipment. Their portability is a key advantage, allowing providers to quickly position the device for optimal recording angles. The user-friendly interfaces of smartphones make setup and recording intuitive, even for those less familiar with advanced camera equipment. Furthermore, modern smartphones are equipped with high-quality cameras that deliver clear and detailed visuals, enabling the capture of intricate surgical details for educational purposes.

Despite their convenience, smartphones have limitations. Manual controls for adjusting exposure and focus might be restricted compared to dedicated cameras, which can affect the quality of recorded footage in challenging lighting conditions. Extensive recording sessions, especially during lengthy procedures, can drain the smartphone's battery rapidly, necessitating careful battery management or backup power solutions. Additionally, recording handheld may lead to shaky footage, impacting the overall viewing experience for those who engage with the content.

To address stability issues during longer recording sessions, consider using a tripod or stabilizer to ensure steady footage. Activate privacy settings to prevent calls or notifications from disrupting the recording process.&#x20;

Lastly, bear in mind that the smartphone should not be for personal use, to avoid data leakage.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**Pros:**</mark>

* **Ubiquitous:** Almost universally owned, smartphones eliminate the need for additional equipment.
* **Portability:** Their small size and weight make them easy to carry and position.
* **User-Friendly:** Familiar interfaces make setup and recording intuitive for most users.
* **High-Quality Cameras:** Modern smartphones boast advanced camera technology for clear visuals.

<mark style="color:red;">**Cons:**</mark>

* **Limited Features:** Manual settings for exposure and focus may be restricted compared to dedicated cameras.
* **Battery Life:** Extensive recording sessions can deplete the battery rapidly, necessitating management.
* **Stabilization:** Handheld recording can introduce shaky footage, impacting viewing quality.
* **Privacy:** it could appear unprofessional to record procedures with a phone.&#x20;

{% tab title="Eye-tracking glasses" %}
Eye-tracking glasses are glasses with a build in camera that the provider can put on. The glasses record a detailed first-person perspective, so you can stand back while observing on a screen in real-time and collecting quality data.

Eye-tracking glasses are also used for research purposes, such as obtaining data on what a person focuses on during the recording.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**Pros:**</mark>

* **Point-of-view recording:** Especially when the procedure can't be visualized from afar, eye-tracking glasses allow for visualization of small procedures.&#x20;
* **Portability:** They are positioned on the head, so you can record a procedure hands-free.
* **High-Quality Cameras:** Eye-tracking glasses boast advanced camera technology for clear visuals.

<mark style="color:red;">**Cons:**</mark>

* **Less user-friendly:** these glasses can be difficult to activate with multiple steps, which is not preferable in an emergency situation.&#x20;
* **Battery Life:** Extensive recording sessions can deplete the battery, necessitating management.
* **Stabilization:** Eye-tracking can introduce shaky footage, impacting viewing quality.
* **Price:** eye-tracking glasses are often quite expensive, ranging from 10.000 - 20.000
