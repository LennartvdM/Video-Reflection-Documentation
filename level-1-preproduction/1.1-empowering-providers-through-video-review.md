# 1.1 Empowering providers through video review

Video review isn't just a tool for individual learningâ€”it's a catalyst for collaboration. By sharing your experiences and techniques through visual documentation, you're opening the door to collaborative discussions among your colleagues. This enables the exchange of insights, refinements of approaches, and the growth of medical care collectively.

The reality of critical or emergency care is that healthcare providers will inevitably encounter unexpected or unforeseen outcomes. A team must react on the fly, and adapt its practice, according to the patient and the context. And with ever increasing complexity of medical care, driven by scientific improvement and the determination of healthcare providers to provide the best possible care for their patients, this grows to be even more challenging. A study from almost 30 years ago, already showed that the average intensive care patient requires 178 individual actions per day, ranging from drug administration to suctioning, some of which are performed in multidisciplinary team collaboration and involved with risks (Donchin et al. 1995). This illustrates how difficult it can be for healthcare teams to ensure that all time-sensitive steps are completed correctly.

When reviewing a medical procedure with everyone involved in hands-on care, it can be used to combine the strengths and forces of a team. Video review empowers providers to make improvements in the quality of care.&#x20;

First, video review has to be organized and implemented in a way that is suitable and safe for the daily practice on a department and involving all disciplines. In level 1, we elaborate on how to structure your Neoflix sessions.&#x20;
