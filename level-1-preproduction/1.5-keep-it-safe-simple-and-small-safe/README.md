# 1.5 Keep it safe, simple and small safe

When determining how to set up your video review project, keep in mind that the most important thing is to keep it small, simple and safe. Video review can be both exciting and scary. Start with recording procedures with all recorded providers who feel comfortable to be recorded. After you make a start, and enthusiasm catches on, you can always prepare to expand your video review project.&#x20;
