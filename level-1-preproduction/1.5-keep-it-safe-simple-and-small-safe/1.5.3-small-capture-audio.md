# 1.5.3 Small: Capture Audio

Audio enriches the educational experience by providing a multi-dimensional understanding of the medical procedure. However, it can also raise concerns about privacy. Remember when setting up your video review project, to start small. You can always expand after you have begun your project.&#x20;

Keep in mind that when recording in a room with a lot of background noise (ventilators, monitoring etc) you might need an additional microphone to reduce background noise.&#x20;
