# 1.4 Gaining Team Buy-In

When introducing the concept of video review to your team, articulate the vision clearly. Emphasize the educational and collaborative benefits and how you aim to maintain the safe learning environment. Highlight what the rules of video review are and be transparent about the whole process.

<mark style="color:orange;">**Highlighting goal and impact**</mark>

Video review can help sharpen skills of medical providers. Video recordings can be shown to the providers to let them reflect on their own performance, in full transparency. Recordings provide an objective view on a procedure and reduces the risk of recall bias. They can be used to compare the performance of procedures to guidelines and protocols, and consequently detect gaps or inaccuracies. This, in turn, can lead to further research. additionally, video review gives an overview on care, visualizing context and time. Organizational and cultural aspects can now also be evaluated and used to drive improvement of care. Studies on video review have shown that teamwork, quality of care and guideline adherence improved after introduction of video review as an intervention to improve care. Research has even shown that video review can result in adjustment of guidelines.&#x20;

You can use the following articles for presenting the impact of video review:

<mark style="color:orange;">**Define roles and responsibilities**</mark>

Clearly define roles within the medical team to manage the recording and reviewing process. Assign responsibilities for who will be in the review team and nudge for recording, for chairing the sessions and for taking care of recording equipment. Inform the team who is the video review confidante they can go to if they do not wish for a recording to be used.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you have a member from each discipline on the video review team, to be able to represent all different stakeholders.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

&#x20;<mark style="color:orange;">**The providers are in control**</mark>

We would recommend to make recording voluntary for providers.\[REF artikel zodra online] Moreover, in our NEOFLIX approach we chose for a triple-consent procedure, 1) before a recording is made, 2) after a recording has been made, and 3) before a video is used for video review. If at any point, a provider does not wish for (a part of) the video to be used for review, the video will not be used. This way, the providers always have the final say in whether a video will be used. It is important that they know this and that there is a dedicated person available for them to approach without feeling any pressure that a video must be used.  \
\
<mark style="color:orange;">**Addressing Concerns**</mark>

Listen attentively to any concerns or reservations raised by your team. Address these concerns openly and transparently. Open dialogue can alleviate apprehensions and foster a sense of unity within the team.

\
<mark style="color:orange;">**Encouraging Engagement, especially among nursing staff**</mark>

Encourage active participation and engagement from your all team members, especially nursing staff. Invite them to provide insights and suggestions for optimizing the recording process. Cultivate an environment of collaboration where team members feel empowered to contribute their expertise.

In the Neoflix project, we used a time that was suitable for nursing staff and medical staff so everyone could attend Neoflix.
