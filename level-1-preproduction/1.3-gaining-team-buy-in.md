# 1.3 Gaining Team Buy-In

**Introducing Video Review: Vision, Transparency, and Empowerment**

When introducing video review, clearly communicate its purpose and potential:

* **Emphasize Learning:** Frame video review as a collaborative tool for skill development and knowledge sharing within a non-judgmental environment.
* **Transparency is Key:** Outline the process, including rules for video usage and a dedicated confidante for addressing any concerns.

**Benefits and Impact:**

* **Objective Reflection:** Video review minimizes recall bias, allowing for detailed analysis of care delivery and comparison with established guidelines.
* **Holistic Understanding:** Videos capture the broader context of care delivery, helping to identify systemic factors that impact patient outcomes.
* **Improvement:** Video review can drive enhancements in teamwork, quality of care, guideline adherence, and even lead to the refinement of existing protocols.

You can use the following articles for presenting the impact of video review. Below you can also find a presentation you can use to introduce video review to your team and a FAQs document.&#x20;

**Team Roles and Empowerment:**

* **Defined Responsibilities:** Outline who manages recordings, chairs reviews, handles equipment, and serves as the video review confidante. Strive for multidisciplinary representation within your review team.
* **Provider Control:** Voluntary participation and triple-consent (before recording, after recording, before review) ensures providers retain control over the process.
* **Addressing Concerns:** Actively listen to team worries and offer open, transparent responses.

Make sure you have a member from each discipline on the video review team, to be able to represent all different stakeholders.&#x20;
