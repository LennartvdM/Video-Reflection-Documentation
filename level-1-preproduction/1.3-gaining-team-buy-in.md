# 1.3 Gaining Team Buy-In

When introducing the concept of video review to your team, articulate the vision clearly. Emphasize the educational and collaborative benefits and how you aim to maintain the safe learning environment. Highlight what the rules of video review are and be transparent about the whole process.

<mark style="color:orange;">**Highlighting goal and impact**</mark>

Video review offers a powerful tool to sharpen medical providers' skills. By showing healthcare professionals recordings of their procedures, it facilitates transparent, collaborative reflection. This objective view reduces recall bias and allows for comparison of performance against guidelines and protocols, highlighting potential gaps or inaccuracies that can fuel further research. Additionally, video review provides a comprehensive overview of care, including context and time factors. This allows for evaluation of organizational and cultural aspects that influence patient care outcomes. Studies have demonstrated that video review interventions can lead to improvements in teamwork, quality of care, and guideline adherence. In some cases, research based on video review has even prompted adjustments to existing guidelines.

You can use the following articles for presenting the impact of video review:

{% tab title="Guidelines" %}
After weekly video review sessions were implemented, providers complied more often to the guideline (63 vs. 77%; p < 0.001).

Based on the results of the following study it was recommended to change the guideline for neonatal intubation during resuscitation.

{% tab title="Quality improvement " %}
Video review and feedback process was significantly associated with improvements in quality metrics for resuscitation in cardiac arrest amongst patients presented to the emergency department.

<mark style="color:orange;">**Define roles and responsibilities**</mark>

Clearly define roles within the medical team to manage the recording and reviewing process. Assign responsibilities for who will be in the review team and nudge for recording, for chairing the sessions and for taking care of recording equipment. Inform the team who is the video review confidante they can go to if they do not wish for a recording to be used.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you have a member from each discipline on the video review team, to be able to represent all different stakeholders.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

&#x20;<mark style="color:orange;">**The providers are in control**</mark>

We would recommend to make recording voluntary for providers. Moreover, in our NEOFLIX approach we chose for a triple-consent procedure, 1) before a recording is made, 2) after a recording has been made, and 3) before a video is used for video review. If at any point, a provider does not wish for (a part of) the video to be used for review, the video will not be used. This way, the providers always have the final say in whether a video will be used. It is important that they know this and that there is a dedicated person available for them to approach without feeling any pressure that a video must be used. &#x20;

<mark style="color:orange;">**Addressing Concerns**</mark>

Listen attentively to any concerns or reservations raised by your team. Address these concerns openly and transparently. Open dialogue can alleviate apprehensions and foster a sense of unity within the team.

\
<mark style="color:orange;">**Encouraging Engagement, especially among nursing staff**</mark>

Encourage active participation and engagement from your all team members, especially nursing staff. Invite them to provide insights and suggestions for optimizing the recording process. Cultivate an environment of collaboration where team members feel empowered to contribute their expertise.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the Neoflix project, we used a time that was suitable for nursing staff and medical staff so everyone could attend Neoflix.
