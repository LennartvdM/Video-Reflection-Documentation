<mark style="color:yellow;">**Portable and Familiar**</mark>\
\
Smartphones have become nearly ubiquitous, eliminating the need for additional recording equipment. Their portability is a key advantage, allowing surgeons to quickly position the device for optimal recording angles. The user-friendly interfaces of smartphones make setup and recording intuitive, even for those less familiar with advanced camera equipment. Furthermore, modern smartphones are equipped with high-quality cameras that deliver clear and detailed visuals, enabling the capture of intricate surgical details for educational purposes.

Despite their convenience, smartphones have limitations. Manual controls for adjusting exposure and focus might be restricted compared to dedicated cameras, which can affect the quality of recorded footage in challenging lighting conditions. Extensive recording sessions, especially during lengthy surgeries, can drain the smartphone's battery rapidly, necessitating careful battery management or backup power solutions. Additionally, recording handheld may lead to shaky footage, impacting the overall viewing experience for those who engage with the content.

To address stability issues during longer recording sessions, consider using a tripod or stabilizer to ensure steady footage. Carry extra chargers or power banks to maintain sufficient power throughout extended procedures. Activate privacy settings to prevent calls or notifications from disrupting the recording process, which could lead to interruptions in critical moments during surgery.\
