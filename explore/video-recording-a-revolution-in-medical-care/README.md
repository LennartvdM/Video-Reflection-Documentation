# Video recording: a revolution in medical care

The use of video recording to visualize real-time medical care has emerged as a powerful tool in the recent years. Pioneered in 1969 by Peltier et al. in emergency medical care as a teaching method, and later adopted in neonatology by Finer et al. for quality assurance, video recording offers an objective view on care unlike any other method. It reveals both visual and auditory details of critical events, providing valuable insights into care practices. Since then, the use of video recording has expanded to other emergency disciplines, including (pediatric) trauma and intensive care, where it plays a role in identifying guideline deviations.

Research demonstrates the profound impact of video review on individual provider performance, enhancing both technical skills (like guideline adherence) and non-technical skills (like communication). Videos reveal the dynamic nature of clinical practice, providing a unique perspective for discussing interventions and refining care beyond simple guideline compliance.

Optimal healthcare often navigates the complexities within medicine where guidelines may be limited. Providers rely on their expertise to customize procedures for the specific needs of a patient, context, and setting. This natural variation in practice offers a rich opportunity for healthcare professionals to learn from each other. Video review facilitates collaborative discussions and the continuous sharpening of skills, ultimately leading to improved quality of care.
