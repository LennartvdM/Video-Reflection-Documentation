# Trailer

Video review is an effective method for improving quality of care and supporting a team to perform to the best of its abilities. Video recording real-time medical procedures visualizes the setting and context in which care is provided, making it a unique tool for reflection. This is especially valuable in emergency or intensive care as the fast-paced and dynamic work environment makes it difficult to reflect on the care provided. The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) is one of the few centers in the world where video recording and reviewing of acute procedures are standard of care since 2014. So far, we have studied how to best organize these video review sessions (also called â€˜Neoflix' sessions) and how to use video review of acute procedures to drive quality improvement. The outcome of research on our department, has be used to develop our NEOFLIX Toolkit; an online toolkit to guide emergency care teams worldwide in organizing video review and providing them with the necessary tools to do so. The toolkit also serves as a platform, generating knowledge, based on collaborative insights from video review. Medical care teams then have the opportunity to interact with each other by organizing multicenter video-review sessions, hereby adding a completely new dimension to reflection.
