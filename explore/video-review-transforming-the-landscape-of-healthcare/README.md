# Video Review: Transforming the Landscape of Healthcare

The integration of video recording into healthcare practices has become transformative, providing an objective and detailed perspective on clinical care. Initially introduced in emergency medicine in 1969 as a teaching tool and later expanded to fields like neonatology for quality assurance, video recording offers a level of insight unachievable with other retrospective assessment methods.

Beyond its early applications, video recording is now widely employed in emergency disciplines – including pediatric trauma and intensive care – to analyze performance and identify potential deviations from established guidelines. Extensive research demonstrates the value of video review in enhancing healthcare provider performance in both technical skills (e.g., guideline adherence) and non-technical skills (e.g., communication, teamwork).

The complexities of optimal healthcare often transcend the limitations of standardized guidelines. Practitioners must draw upon their expertise to individualize care based on patient-specific needs and contextual factors. Video recordings capture these inherent variations in practice, providing a rich resource for collaborative analysis among healthcare professionals. This open sharing of experiences allows for continuous learning, refinement of clinical judgment, and ultimately, the elevation of patient care standards.
