# Taking a different approach

Studies on video review often measure quality improvement only by identifying a decrease in errors or deviation from guidelines. This approach potentially limits the power of video review. It tries to increase safety by ensuring that as few things as possible go wrong, defined in safety management as a safety-I approach. According to safety-I, mistakes are made because of technical, human or organizational causes. However, with ever increasing complex healthcare settings, a new way of safety has emerged in the recent years, called safety-II; the ability to succeed under varying conditions. It acknowledges that practice is often quite different from how care is imagined in the guidelines. Instead of just focusing on mistakes, it focuses understanding how things usually go right as a basis for explaining how things occasionally go wrong. In safety-II, learning from variability and performance adjustments is seen as the basis that leads to new insights.

&#x20;Video review thus offers the possibility of taking quality improvement to the next level. It could be an alternative approach to improving quality of care by learning from reality and strengthening the resilience of the caregivers. When recording and reviewing procedures with all staff members involved, caregivers can become aware of all the different technical and non-technical aspects, next to the time and context in which care is provided. Technical skills are important, but non-technical skills are also highly influential for clinical performance, such as leadership and teamwork, coping with stress and communication with patients. Finally, cultural and organizational aspects are important for patient care. By visualizing these aspects that are necessary to ensure the best outcome in care, video review becomes a valuable tool for quality improvement. Reviewing workflow during a medical procedure clarifies each member's responsibilities and reinforces effective communication patterns. Though safety-II, you enhance the system's ability to succeed under varying conditions and you try to make acceptable outcomes of everyday activities as high as possible. When reviewing videos together with everyone involved in hands-on care, small improvements of everyday performance can be proposed.
