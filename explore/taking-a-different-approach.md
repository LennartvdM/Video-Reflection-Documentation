# Taking a different approach

Studies on video review often measure quality improvement only by identifying a decrease in errors or deviation from guidelines. This approach potentially limits the power of video review. It tries to increase safety by ensuring that as few things as possible go wrong, defined in safety management as a safety-I approach. According to safety-I, mistakes are made because of technical, human or organizational causes. However, with ever increasing complex healthcare settings, a new way of safety has emerged in the recent years, called safety-II; the ability to succeed under varying conditions. It acknowledges that practice is often quite different from how care is imagined in the guidelines. Instead of just focusing on mistakes, it focuses understanding how things usually go right as a basis for explaining how things occasionally go wrong. In safety-II, learning from variability and performance adjustments is seen as the basis that leads to new insights.

Studies on video review often focus on quality improvement by measuring a decrease in errors or deviations from guidelines. However, this approach has limitations; it emphasizes safety by minimizing negative outcomes (the Safety-I approach), assuming mistakes stem from individual technical, human, or organizational failures. In the increasingly complex world of healthcare, a newer safety model has emerged: Safety-II. This approach focuses on the ability to succeed under varying conditions, acknowledging that real-world practice often differs from idealized guidelines. Instead of solely analyzing mistakes, Safety-II studies how things usually go right, providing insights into occasional failures. It values learning from variability and performance adjustments as a source of new knowledge.

Video review offers a powerful opportunity to elevate quality improvement in healthcare. It provides an alternative approach, grounded in real-world practice, to enhance care quality and caregiver resilience. By recording and reviewing procedures with all involved staff, caregivers become aware of the interconnected technical and non-technical aspects of care â€“ including the context and time pressures they work within. While technical skills are crucial, non-technical skills like leadership, teamwork, stress management, and patient communication significantly impact clinical performance. Additionally, video review can highlight crucial cultural and organizational factors that influence patient outcomes.

By visualizing these essential components of care, video review becomes an invaluable quality improvement tool. Reviewing workflow clarifies team member responsibilities and reinforces effective communication. This aligns with the Safety-II approach, which focuses on enhancing a system's ability to succeed under varying conditions and optimizing everyday outcomes. When reviewing videos with all hands-on care providers, opportunities for incremental improvements in daily performance become visible.
