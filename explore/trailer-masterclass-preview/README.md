# Trailer / masterclass preview

Video review offers a powerful tool for quality improvement and team development in healthcare. By recording real-time medical procedures, it captures the unique context and dynamics of care, facilitating valuable reflection â€“ particularly in fast-paced environments like emergency or intensive care. The Leiden University Medical Center's (LUMC) Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) has successfully integrated video review into standard practice since 2014. Extensive research within this unit has informed the development of the NEOFLIX Toolkit, an online resource designed to help emergency care teams worldwide implement video review. The toolkit also establishes a collaborative platform for knowledge sharing and multicenter video review sessions, adding a new dimension to professional reflection and advancement.

We invite you to join the Neoflix network and experience video review yourself.&#x20;
