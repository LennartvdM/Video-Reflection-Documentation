# History of video recording and reviewing in medical care

An emerging tool is the use of video recording for visualization of real-time care. In 1969, Peltier et al. was the first to describe the use of video recording in medical care. In Neonatology, Finer et al. used video recording for the first time, to identify guideline deviations in neonatal resuscitation as part of quality assurance. Video recording gives an objective view on provided care and allows for observation of visual and auditory aspects of a critical event. Since then, other emergency disciplines have adopted the use of video recording, including (pediatric) trauma and intensive care, for identifying errors in resuscitation. However, due to the occurrence of interrater variability during video assessment, coherent evaluation of videos remains difficult.

Studies on video review have proven that technical aspects, such as guideline adherence, and non-technical aspects such as communication improve.

<summary>LUMC</summary>

The Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) is a tertiary university-affiliated hospital, containing a 25-bed NICU, annually admitting 500-600 neonates. In 2009, the NICU of the LUMC implemented recording of neonatal stabilization for research purposes. Recordings captured the hands of the caregivers, the infant and the physiological parameters. It led to many discoveries about physiology, but also guideline compliance, showing that caregivers frequently diverged from guidelines and documentation was often insufficient.

Weekly video review of neonatal stabilization was implemented in 2014 by the NICU of the LUMC, with mostly medical staff attending. Video review resulted in improved guideline compliance and documentation.
