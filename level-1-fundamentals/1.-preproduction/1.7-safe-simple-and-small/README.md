# 1.7 Safe, Simple & Small

## Starting Your Video Review Project: Safe, Simple, Small

Begin your video review journey with a focus on safety, simplicity, and manageable scale. Here's how:

* **Prioritize a Safe Environment:** Emphasize the voluntary nature of participation and establish a culture of support within your team.
* **Keep it Simple:** Start with straightforward procedures and a user-friendly recording setup.
* **Start Small & Build Momentum:** Avoid overcomplicating the process early on, as enthusiasm and confidence grow, you can strategically expand the scope of your project, for example by adding audio.

**Navigating the Complexities of Video Review**

While video review offers tremendous benefits for patient care, quality improvement, research, and education, its implementation requires careful consideration:

* **Balancing Interests:** Different stakeholders (patients, providers, researchers) may have varying needs and priorities regarding video usage. Finding the right balance is crucial.
* **Ethical Considerations:** Protecting patient privacy and provider autonomy is essential. Open dialogue with all involved parties will help address potential concerns.
* **Legal Uncertainties:** While quality improvement recordings often receive legal protection, their use in potential court proceedings remains a gray area. Seek guidance from your legal team.

**Important Reminders:**

* **Adverse Event Reporting:** This remains a mandatory obligation, regardless of video recordings.
* **Informed Consent:** Choose a consent model suitable for your setting, addressing both patient and provider rights.&#x20;

## [<mark style="color:blue;">**Simple:**</mark>](simple/) **Recording**

Focus on a familiar task. Even simple activities can reveal patterns, habits, and areas for refinement upon review.

## **Key Considerations:**

* **Storage:**
  * **De-identification:** Are patient and provider identifiers removed to protect privacy?
  * **Location:** Where will recordings be stored (local server, cloud-based, etc.)?
* **Protection:**
  * **Encryption:** Are recordings deidentified when they are stored?
  * **Access Control:** Implement strict access control measures (role-based permissions, audit logs)
* **Retention:**
  * **Timeframe:** Define a clear data retention policy based on your purposes and local regulations.

**Legal Context:**

* **Quality Assurance Protection:** Explore if local laws offer protection for recordings marked for quality improvement purposes.
* **Case Law:** Stay informed about emerging legal precedents related to the use of medical video recordings in court cases.

So far, no legal cases have been reported by NICU's. The NICU of the LUMC has implemented recording and reviewing of neonatal stabilization since 2014 and has not encountered any medicolegal issues. It is not yet clear if recordings can be used in court. (Den boer et al 2018)

**Recording Equipment Selection:**

* **Simplicity First:** Start with readily available technology (smartphones, tablets, basic cameras) for initial setup.
* **Later Upgrades:** As your program matures, consider incorporating:
  * **Respiratory Monitors:** If applicable, add devices to capture respiratory data alongside video
  * **Specialized Equipment:** Explore high-end options for image quality, multiple angles, etc.

## [<mark style="color:blue;">**Small**</mark>](small.md)<mark style="color:blue;">**:**</mark>** Capture Audio**

**The Value and Complexities of Audio in Video Review**

Audio plays a crucial role in video review for healthcare. It enriches the learning experience by capturing elements that visuals alone cannot:

* **Verbal Communication:** Reveals nuances of team interactions, provider-patient dialogue, and decision-making processes.
* **Patient Reactions:** Captures subtle but important patient sounds like breathing patterns.

However, audio also raises significant privacy concerns:

* **Identifiable Information:** Voices and background conversations can easily reveal patient and provider identities.
* **Sensitive Discussions:** Recordings may capture confidential diagnoses, family dynamics, or ethically complex situations.

**Balancing Benefits and Privacy**

* **Selective Audio Recording:** Consider recording audio only when essential for learning objectives and delete it afterwards if not strictly necessary.
* **De-identification:** If possible, explore audio de-identification techniques (e.g., voice modulation) while preserving clinically relevant information.
* **Strict Consent:** Obtain explicit consent from providers for audio recording, especially when identifiable.

### **Strategic Implementation: Start Small, Scale Thoughtfully**

As with any new technology, starting small with video review allows you to:

* **Focus on Buy-In:** Build trust among providers and patients by starting with less sensitive procedures and clear communication about audio usage.
* **Refine Processes:** Develop robust protocols for audio recording, storage, management, and deletion.
* **Assess Value:** Evaluate the added benefits of audio against logistical and ethical considerations.

**Remember, a phased approach empowers you to make informed decisions about expanding your project while prioritizing patient and provider privacy alongside educational gains.**
