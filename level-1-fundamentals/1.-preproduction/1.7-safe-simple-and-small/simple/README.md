# Simple

## **Consider the following questions:**&#x20;

#### **Storage:**

* **De-identification:** Are patient and provider identifiers removed to protect privacy?
* **Location:** Where will recordings be stored (local server, cloud-based, etc.)?

#### **Protection:**

* **Encryption:** Are recordings deidentified when they are stored?
* **Access Control:** Are access control measures implemented?(role-based permissions, audit logs)

#### **Legal Context:**

* **Quality Assurance Protection:** Are recordings [offered protection](../safe/check-for-institutional-rules.md) as they are marked for quality assurance purposes?&#x20;
* **Case Law:** Stay informed about emerging legal precedents related to the use of medical video recordings in court cases.

So far, no legal cases have been reported by any NICU. The [NICU of the LUMC ](../../../../welcome/neoflix/streamlining-neonatal-care-a-success-story.md)has implemented recording and reviewing of neonatal stabilization since 2014 and has not encountered any medicolegal issues. It is not yet clear if recordings can be used in court. (Den boer et al 2018)

#### **Recording** [**Equipment Selection**](../../../../level-2-in-action/3.-equipment/)**:**

* **Simplicity First:** Do you already have readily available technology (smartphones, tablets, basic cameras) for initial setup?
* **Later Upgrades:** As your program matures, consider incorporating:
  * **Respiratory Monitors:** If applicable, add devices to capture respiratory data alongside video.
  * **Specialized Equipment:** Explore high-end options for image quality, multiple angles, etc.

Providers might feel uneasy about how their recordings are handled, leading to distrust and reluctance to participate. The lack of transparency could generate concerns about privacy, misuse of videos, and potential legal complications. This could undermine the learning process and hinder the program's ability to positively impact safety.</mark></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
