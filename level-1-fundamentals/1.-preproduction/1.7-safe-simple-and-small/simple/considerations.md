# Considerations

## Potential recording equipment options for capturing procedures in a hospital setting include:

* [Fixed cameras:](../../../../level-2-in-action/3.-equipment/3.1-any-device/fixed-cameras.md)
  * Strategically installed in operating rooms, procedure suites, or resuscitation bays.
  * May offer overhead views for a broader perspective or capture specific areas of focus.
  * Ideal for recording established workflows and team dynamics.
* [Mobile cameras:](../../../../level-2-in-action/3.-equipment/3.1-any-device/mobile-cameras.md)
  * Mounted on tripods or wheeled carts for flexible repositioning.
  * Useful for capturing different angles or when procedures occur in varied locations.
  * Can be easily moved to accommodate unexpected events or patient needs.
* [Wearable cameras:](../../../../level-2-in-action/3.-equipment/3.1-any-device/wearable-cameras.md)
  * Head-mounted or body-worn by individual healthcare providers.
  * Provide a first-person perspective for detailed skill assessment and training.
  * Allow focus on specific hands-on tasks or techniques.
* [Patient monitoring systems:](../../../../level-2-in-action/3.-equipment/3.1-any-device/patient-monitoring-systems.md)
  * Some existing monitoring equipment may have built-in recording capabilities.
  * Can streamline recording if systems already capture relevant video and audio data.
* [<mark style="color:blue;">Motion-detecting cameras</mark>](../../../../level-2-in-action/3.-equipment/3.1-any-device/motion-detecting-cameras.md)<mark style="color:blue;">:</mark>&#x20;
  * Motion-detecting cameras streamline medical procedure recording, automatically capturing unexpected events.
  * Necessitate transparent consent and privacy protocols.

## Important Considerations:

* Security and privacy: Systems must align with [hospital data security and patient privacy regulations](../safe/check-for-institutional-rules.md) (e.g., HIPAA compliant).
* Storage and access: Integration with secure storage and controlled access protocols is a must.
* Ease of use: Equipment should be intuitive for staff to operate to minimize disruptions to workflow.
* Cost and scalability: Consider the initial investment, as well as any ongoing costs associated with storage and maintenance.
