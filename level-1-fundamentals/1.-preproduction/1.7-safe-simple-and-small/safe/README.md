Securing Consent: A Crucial Step for Video Review in Healthcare

**Consent is the foundation of ethical video review in healthcare.** However, procedures for obtaining consent can vary significantly between hospitals, both within and across countries.

**Understanding Your Institution's Rules:**

Before implementing video review, familiarizing yourself with your [hospital's policies ](check-for-institutional-rules.md)is crucial. These policies typically address obtaining and documenting informed consent from patients and staff regarding:

* Recording procedures
* Data storage and access
* Video usage for educational or quality improvement purposes

Understanding these policies ensures your video review initiative adheres to best practices and aligns with your institution's legal and ethical frameworks.

### Consider the following questions:

#### **Patient consent**

When and how are patients informed?

* [ ] Should patients explicitly consent?&#x20;
* [ ] Can patients request to delete recordings?
* [ ] Who can be contacted in case of questions?
* [ ] Will recordings be shared with patients?

{% hint style="info" %}
Research on the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), showed that sharing recordings of neonatal stabilization with parents, can be beneficial for parents and their coping. Parents of infants admitted to the NICU of the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), reviewed recordings and reported that they appreciated it and doing so, made them less likely to hold providers responsible for medical malpractice (den Boer et al. 2021).

**Provider consent**

* [ ] When and how are providers informed?
* [ ] Should providers explicitly consent?
* [ ] Can individual providers refuse recording or reviewing?&#x20;

The _Neoflix_ approach recommends you to use a [triple consent](../../../../level-2-in-action/2.-preparation-and-consent/2.1-obtain-consent.md) procedure.

This builds trust and empowers them, increasing their willingness to participate. The ability to withdraw consent at any time reduces anxiety and fosters a positive learning environment. The focus on consent also encourages open communication, leading to greater collaboration and better overall outcomes.</mark></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><mark style="color:red;">Not asking for consent in your video review program undermines trust and erodes provider autonomy. This can lead to resistance, resentment, and a decreased willingness to participate, limiting the potential for learning and improvement. Providers may feel anxious or concerned that their work could be used without their knowledge or approval, hindering a positive learning environment. The lack of open communication about the process could lead to misunderstandings, further damaging trust and potentially compromising the entire program's success.</mark></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
