# Small

**Consider the following questions:**

### Usage of audio

* **Legal Questions:** What are the specific privacy laws in your hospital regarding audio recordings in healthcare settings? Do they differ from video recording regulations?
* **Provider Concerns:** How do you anticipate healthcare providers might feel about audio recording compared to video recording alone? For more information, [click here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/MdMcavmFWyJ3gxr9PXYq/summaries-articles/3.-providers-perspective).
* **Benefits:** Consider what the value of audio is. If you are recording communication and teamwork, it is invaluable!

### **Technical and Logistical Considerations**

* **Storage and Security:** Does your hospital have systems in place to handle audio data with the same level of security and encryption as video?
* **Workflow Impact:** If selective audio recording is used, how will decisions be made on when to enable audio and who will be responsible? Could this create extra steps and workflow disruptions?

### **Implementation Strategy**

* **"Low-Hanging Fruit":** Which types of procedures might be ideal starting points for audio-inclusive video review (low-risk, high educational value)?
* **Buy-in Strategies:** How could you address potential concerns and promote understanding among staff and patients about the potential benefits and risks of audio recording?
* **Scaling Considerations:** What factors would need to be in place to justify expanding the use of audio in video review on a larger scale?



<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><mark style="color:green;">A small, focused approach to video review reduces initial resistance, builds trust, and allows for faster implementation. By starting with easily obtainable elements and addressing privacy concerns (such as initially omitting audio), you create early successes and a strong foundation for expansion. This strategic approach streamlines the process, making it adaptable to your team's needs while demonstrating the value of video review.</mark></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:red;">If you don't start small with video review, you risk overwhelming your team and encountering greater resistance. Attempting to tackle too many variables at once (e.g., audio, complex procedures, etc.) can create logistical hurdles and complicate analysis. This may lead to delays, frustration, and a perception that video review is overly complicated. Additionally, unresolved privacy concerns or immediate technological challenges can undermine trust and discourage participation. Overall, not starting small can hinder the early success of the project and make it more difficult to build momentum for improvement.</mark></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

**By starting small, you can begin to foster your **_**Neoflix**_** video review program, and sustain the safety. You can always expand later on. Just begin!**
