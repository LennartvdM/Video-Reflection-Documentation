# 1.5 Pioneer team

## **g Your **_**Neoflix**_** Dream Team**

The key to video review success lies with your pioneers â€“ those trusted and respected individuals who will champion this powerful process. These pioneers should:

* **Lead by Example:** Record their procedures as the first providers, showing a willingness to grow and learn.
* **Be Change Agents:** Actively help set up _Neoflix_ and support others embracing change.
* **Represent the Team:** Include pioneers from various disciplines (doctors, nurses, etc.) for a holistic approach.

Think of these questions as you identify your pioneers:

* [ ] Do colleagues deeply trust them?
* [ ] Are their skills and judgment widely respected?
* [ ] Does the group reflect the diversity of your NICU?

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><mark style="color:green;">Trust is vital for creating an environment where people feel comfortable participating in video review. By carefully selecting a pioneer team that embodies empathy, understanding, and a learning mindset, you're fostering this essential trust. A diverse pioneer team, representing various disciplines within your unit, builds inclusivity and ensures everyone feels represented. People are more likely to approach someone who understands their specific work context and challenges. This approachable team encourages open communication, guaranteeing that if anyone faces difficulties during the video review process, they feel comfortable seeking guidance.</mark></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><mark style="color:red;">If certain disciplines feel underrepresented or unheard, they may be less likely to trust the process. This can lead to reluctance in sharing videos or engaging in constructive feedback. In addition, without input from a diverse pioneer team, the analysis of videos might miss crucial insights specific to different disciplines. This could result in incomplete solutions or recommendations that don't address system-wide improvements. Finally, individuals from underrepresented disciplines might feel excluded and less valued. This can discourage participation and make them less likely to raise concerns or offer suggestions for improvement.</mark></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Empowerment is Key**

Your NEOFLIX team thrives on a clear structure and provider empowerment:

* **Define Roles:** Who manages videos, chairs reviews, etc? Keep it multidisciplinary!
* **Provider Control:** If recording is voluntary, consent is needed at multiple stages.
* **Listen & Respond:** Address concerns openly and honestly.

**Your Success Starts with Your Pioneers!** With their dedication and enthusiasm, you'll create a culture of continuous improvement and the best possible care for your little patients.
