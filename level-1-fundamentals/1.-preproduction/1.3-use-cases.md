# 1.3 Use Cases

Video review has diverse applications. Consider these examples, and you might realize you're already closer to using video review than you think...

* **Interdisciplinary understanding:** Strong communication between specialists is crucial, yet each role has its own focus. Share recordings with those in different roles, fostering a deeper understanding of how seemingly small actions impact overall care. This can lead to more empathetic and efficient collaboration.

_<mark style="color:blue;">A scheduled knee replacement went smoothly with no complications. The OR team took the initiative to review the recorded procedure afterward. They were surprised to notice a few instances of near-misses with instrument hand-offs and moments of slight workflow confusion. While no actual errors had occurred, the team used these observations to refine their communication protocols. They implemented a simple checklist to confirm roles and responsibilities at key points during surgery, leading to increased efficiency and a stronger sense of teamwork in the OR.</mark>_

* **Parents' perspective:** Reviewing recordings of neonatal stabilization with parents offers valuable insights into their experiences. Their direct feedback reveals emotions and needs during that critical time. Key parental insights shared during review sessions, enrich discussions and foster a deeper understanding of how to best support families.

_<mark style="color:blue;">The parents of a newborn premature infant watched the video of their newborn's stabilization. It was a whirlwind of medical jargon and frantic movements. But as they voiced their fear and confusion, the medical staff found ways to include parents in the care process, making the NICU less intimidating and fostering a deeper understanding of the family's experience.</mark>_

* **Targeted Skill Development:** Trainees can record themselves performing specific tasks. This facilitates individualized coaching, even when in-person guidance is limited.

_<mark style="color:blue;">Trainee intensivists record themselves performing elective intubations. Later on, together with other trainees, they review the recordings with a specialist, receiving feedback from their peers as well.</mark>_

* **Real-time & review:** Experienced neonatologists provide real-time guidance on emergency resuscitation cases via teleconferencing software incorporating a live view of the procedure.

_<mark style="color:blue;">A premature infant struggles for life in a remote Australian outback hospital. With no neonatologist on-site, the team initiates a teleconference with specialists thousands of miles away. The specialists, use the video feed to guide the local staff. They instruct them on delicate life-saving procedures. Afterwards, they review the recording together with the local staff and evaluate the procedure and the guidance given through teleconferencing.</mark>_&#x20;

* **Global Knowledge Sharing:** Experienced specialists can provide detailed feedback on recordings from colleagues practicing in under-resourced regions. This benefits patients worldwide.

_<mark style="color:blue;">A remote, low-resource setting hospital, records a medical emergency. Specialists thousands of miles away, from a higher-resource setting, review the video together with the team, identifying a new way of how to respond in the specific medical emergency. Later, the clinic shares their successful outcome. Both the remote team and the specialists gain valuable knowledge, demonstrating the power of collaborative learning across resource-rich and resource-limited settings.</mark>_
