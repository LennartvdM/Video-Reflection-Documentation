* [**Technology**](1.7-safe-simple-and-small/#starting-your-video-review-project-safe-simple-small)**:** Choose recording devices that are easy to use, and suited to your needs.
* [**Budget**](1.5-pioneer-team.md#creating-your-neoflix-team)**:** Factor in costs of hardware (if needed), and potential staff time for review sessions.
* [**Workflow Integration**](1.7-safe-simple-and-small/#simple-recording)**:** Plan how video review will fit into existing processes without creating excessive workload burdens.
  * Make sure to choose a time suitable for both medical and nursing staff.&#x20;
